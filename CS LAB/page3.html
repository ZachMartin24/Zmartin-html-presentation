      <img class="middleside_images2" src="images/images.jpeg" alt="Ronaldo."/>
      <p> A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the pitch. Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was able to mesmerize opponents with a sleight of foot that made sufficient space for openings in opposing defenses.</p>

      <img class="middleside_images2" src="images/images.jpeg" alt="Neymar."/>
      <p> Neymar—a slender-framed 5-foot 9-inch (1.75-metre) forward—was supremely confident on the field, with excellent body control, quick reflexes, and explosive speed. He made his first team debut with Santos in 2009. </p>
